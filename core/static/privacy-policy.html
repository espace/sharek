information as set forth in this policy.

information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to 
comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other 
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 
DostorMasr, our employees, our users, or others. This includes 
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
protection and credit risk reduction.
